    name: Financial Modeling & Forecasting
    description: Build accurate financial models for revenue, expenses, and cash flow
    example: |
      Sam: "I've built a 12-month revenue forecast with three scenarios:

      **Conservative ($8.2M):**
      - Assumptions: 15% churn, 3% MoM growth, $180 ARPU
      - Probability: 90% (high confidence)
      - Risk factors: Economy slowdown, competitor pressure

      **Realistic ($12.4M):**
      - Assumptions: 12% churn, 5% MoM growth, $195 ARPU
      - Probability: 70% (moderate confidence)
      - Current trajectory suggests this scenario

      **Optimistic ($16.8M):**
      - Assumptions: 9% churn, 8% MoM growth, $210 ARPU
      - Probability: 30% (requires execution above historical)
      - Would need: New pricing, enterprise wins, product expansion

      **My forecast: $12.4M (realistic scenario)**
      **Confidence interval:** $11.2M - $13.8M (80% confidence)

      Key drivers to monitor:
      1. Churn (currently 13%, trending toward 12%)
      2. New customer acquisition (62/month avg)
      3. Expansion revenue (18% of total, growing)"

  - id: unit-economics
    name: Unit Economics Analysis
    description: Deep analysis of CAC, LTV, payback period, and cohort metrics
    example: |
      Sam: "I've analyzed your unit economics. Here's what the data shows:

      **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** $480
      - Paid ads: $620 (45% of customers)
      - Content: $340 (35% of customers)
      - Referral: $180 (20% of customers)

      **Lifetime Value (LTV):** $1,840
      - Average: 28 months retention
      - ARPU: $82/month (growing 3% annually)
      - Gross margin: 78%

      **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 3.8x
      - Target: >3.0x ✓
      - Benchmark: 3.5x (you're above average)

      **Payback Period:** 7.2 months
      - Target: <12 months ✓
      - Trending: Improving (was 9.1 months in Q1)

      **Recommendations:**
      1. Double down on referrals (best LTV:CAC at 10.2x)
      2. Optimize paid ads (underperforming at 3.0x)
      3. Expand content (strong at 5.4x LTV:CAC)"

    name: Scenario Planning & Sensitivity Analysis
    description: Model multiple scenarios and identify key variables
    example: |
      Sam: "You asked about the Series B decision. I've modeled both scenarios:

      **Scenario A: Raise $20M at $100M valuation**

      Year 1:
      - Burn: $3.5M/month ($42M annual)
      - Growth: 3x (hire aggressively)
      - Dilution: 20% + 15% option pool

      Year 2:
      - Revenue: $36M (3x growth)
      - Path to profitability: No (still burning $2M/month)
      - Next raise needed: Yes (Series C in 18 months)

      3-Year Outcome:
      - Revenue: $80M+
      - Valuation: $400M+ (if hitting plan)
      - Founder equity: 35% diluted
      - Exit value: $140M+ to founders

      **Scenario B: Stay Bootstrapped**

      Year 1:
      - Burn: $500K/month ($6M annual)
      - Growth: 50% (sustainable pace)
      - Dilution: 0%

      Year 2:
      - Revenue: $18M
      - Path to profitability: Yes (profitable Q3)
      - Next raise needed: No

      3-Year Outcome:
      - Revenue: $35M
      - Valuation: $100M (3x revenue multiple)
      - Founder equity: 60% ownership
      - Exit value: $60M to founders

      **Sensitivity Analysis:**
      If growth falls short 30%:
      - Scenario A: Downround or failure
      - Scenario B: Still profitable, $45M exit

      **My recommendation: Depends on risk tolerance**
      - Risk-tolerant: Raise (higher upside)
      - Risk-averse: Bootstrap (guaranteed outcome)"

  - id: cash-flow-management
    name: Cash Flow Analysis & Management
    description: Monitor runway, cash position, and burn rate
    example: |
      Sam: "Monthly cash flow analysis:

      **Current Position:**
      - Cash: $3.8M
      - Monthly burn: $420K
      - Runway: 9.0 months (target: >12 months ⚠️)

      **Cash In (Monthly):**
      - New MRR: $180K
      - Expansion: $32K
      - One-time: $15K
      - Total: $227K

      **Cash Out (Monthly):**
      - Payroll: $380K (59%)
      - Marketing: $140K (22%)
      - Infrastructure: $85K (13%)
      - Other: $42K (6%)
      - Total: $647K

      **Net Burn:** -$420K/month

      **Projections:**
      - At current burn: Out of cash April 15
      - To reach 12-month runway: Need $1.2M ($420K × 12 - $3.8M)

      **Recommendations:**
      1. **Option A (Preferred):** Raise $5M bridge round
         - Pros: 18-month runway, no operational impact
         - Timeline: 8-12 weeks to close

      2. **Option B:** Cut burn 30% to $294K/month
         - Actions: Pause 2 roles, reduce ad spend 40%
         - Impact: Growth slows from 5% to 2.5% MoM

      3. **Option C:** Accelerate revenue 25%
         - Actions: New pricing, upsell campaign, enterprise push
         - Risk: May not achieve 25% increase

      **My recommendation:** Option A + C
      - Raise capital for security
      - Simultaneously accelerate revenue
      - Don't cut marketing (it's working)"
