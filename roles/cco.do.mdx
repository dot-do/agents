**CCO.do** is your AI-powered customer success leader, maximizing lifetime value through intelligent health monitoring, proactive churn prevention, automated onboarding, and expansion management. Achieve 92% retention and 125% net revenue retention.

## Why CCO.do?

Customer success teams are overwhelmed:
- **Reactive approach** means churn is discovered too late
- **Manual health tracking** doesn't scale beyond 50 accounts per CSM
- **Generic onboarding** leads to 30%+ early churn
- **Missed expansion** opportunities due to lack of visibility
- **Siloed data** makes it impossible to see the full customer picture

CCO.do solves these challenges with AI that continuously monitors health, predicts churn, automates onboarding, and identifies expansion opportunities.

## Key Capabilities

### 💚 Customer Health Monitoring
Get real-time health scores for every customer based on product usage, engagement, commercial metrics, and sentiment. Identify at-risk customers 21 days earlier on average.

### 🛡️ Proactive Churn Prevention
ML models predict churn risk with 89% accuracy. Automated playbooks trigger personalized interventions that save 73% of at-risk accounts.

### 🚀 Intelligent Onboarding Automation
Personalized onboarding journeys reduce time-to-value by 60% and increase completion rates to 87%. Proactive guidance prevents early churn.

### 📈 Revenue Expansion Management
AI identifies upsell and cross-sell opportunities based on usage patterns, achieving 38% expansion rates and 125% net revenue retention.

### 💬 Customer Feedback Intelligence
Aggregate feedback from all sources, analyze sentiment and themes, and route insights to product and CS teams automatically.

## Real-World Results

- **SaaS Growth Platform**: 44% churn reduction, $1.8M ARR saved, 118% NRR
- **DataAnalytics Corp**: 60% faster onboarding, 87% completion rate, 54% less early churn
- **Enterprise CloudOps**: 132% NRR, 38% expansion rate, 4.2x CS team productivity

1. **Monitor** - Continuous health scoring across usage, engagement, and commercial signals
2. **Predict** - ML models forecast churn risk and expansion potential
3. **Act** - Automated playbooks trigger interventions and expansion plays
4. **Engage** - Personalized onboarding and in-app guidance

      const health = await ai.analyze({
        customer,
        signals: ['usage', 'engagement', 'commercial', 'sentiment']
      })

      await db.customers.update(customer.id, {
        healthScore: health.score,
        riskFactors: health.risks
      })

      if (health.score < 0.6) {
        await triggerIntervention(customer, health)
      }
    }
  })

  // Churn prevention
  every('day', async () => {
    const predictions = await ai.predict({

        type: 'churn-intervention',
        customerId: prediction.customerId,

      subject: 'Welcome!',
      template: 'onboarding-welcome',
      data: { customer, journey }
    })
  })

  // Expansion opportunities

    const opportunities = await ai.analyze({
      customers: await db.customers.findAll({ healthScore: { $gt: 0.75 } }),
      identify: 'expansion-opportunities'
    })

    for (const opp of opportunities) {
      await send.email(opp.customer.csm.email, {
