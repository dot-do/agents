# Inventory Clerk Agent

An AI agent that automates inventory tracking, stock monitoring, and reorder management with 76% AI performance efficiency.

## Core Capabilities

The agent handles four critical inventory functions:

- **Stock Monitoring** - Real-time tracking across multiple locations
- **Reorder Automation** - Generates purchase orders when stock low
- **Discrepancy Resolution** - Identifies and reconciles count mismatches
- **Alert Management** - Proactive notifications for critical issues

## Inventory Tracking

**Monitoring Criteria:**
- Current quantity vs minimum threshold
- Days of supply remaining
- Warehouse location status
- Pending orders in transit

**Alert Thresholds:**
- **Critical** (<7 days supply) - Immediate reorder
- **Warning** (7-14 days) - Prepare reorder
- **Normal** (14+ days) - Monitor only

## Reorder Logic

The agent calculates optimal reorder quantities:

```yaml
reorderQuantity:
  calculation: (demandRate * leadTime * safetyFactor) - currentStock
  safetyFactor: 1.5  # 50% buffer
  minimumOrder: supplier.minimumOrderQuantity
```

**Decision Factors:**
1. Historical demand patterns
2. Supplier lead times
3. Storage capacity constraints
4. Budget availability
5. Seasonal trends

## Discrepancy Reconciliation

**Common Issues:**
- Physical count ≠ system count
- Damaged/returned items not logged
- Theft or loss detection
- Data entry errors

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Agent identifies mismatch
2. Reviews recent transactions
3. Generates reconciliation report
4. Updates system records
5. Flags for human review if >$500 variance

## Integration Points

**Inventory Management System:**
- Real-time stock level queries
- Transaction history access
- Reorder request submission

**Warehouse Scanner System:**
- Barcode scan imports
- Physical count verification
- Location tracking updates

**Purchasing System:**
- Supplier catalog access
- Purchase order generation
- Order status tracking

## Usage Examples

### Low Stock Alert

```yaml
trigger: scheduled-check (hourly)
condition: productStock < reorderThreshold
action:
  - generate-reorder-list
  - notify-purchasing-team
  - update-dashboard
```

### Discrepancy Found

```yaml
trigger: physical-count-complete
condition: physicalCount ≠ systemCount
action:
  - calculate-variance
  - review-transactions
  - generate-reconciliation-report
  - flag-if-threshold-exceeded
```

## Performance Metrics

**Tracked KPIs:**
- **Stock Accuracy** - System vs physical count match rate
- **Stockout Prevention** - % of avoided stockouts
- **Reorder Efficiency** - Time from threshold to PO
- **Cost Savings** - Reduced emergency orders

**Target Metrics:**
- 99%+ inventory accuracy
- <1% stockout rate
- <4 hour reorder generation
- 30% reduction in rush orders
