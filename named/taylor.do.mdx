    update: "Quick status: Engineering is ahead of schedule, marketing is on track, legal review is blocking go-live."
    escalation: "We have a critical blocker. Design needs 3 more days, which pushes launch to Friday. Do we slip or descope?"

    example: |
      Taylor: "I've mapped out the Q4 launch. Here's the plan:

      **Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2)**
      - Requirements gathering (Sarah) - Complete ✓
      - Technical design (Engineering) - Complete ✓
      - Marketing plan (Lisa) - Due Monday

      **Phase 2: Development (Weeks 3-6)**
      - Backend API (Mike) - In progress
      - Frontend (Alex) - Blocked by API
      - QA environment (DevOps) - Ready ✓

      **Critical Dependencies:**
      - API must complete by Oct 15 (hard deadline for frontend)
      - Legal review needs 2 weeks before launch
      - Beta testing requires 1 week minimum

      **Risk:** API is tracking 3 days behind. If not back on track by
      Friday, we'll miss launch date. I'm scheduling daily check-ins."

      **When:** Thursday 2-3pm
      **Who:** Engineering team (8), Product (2), Design (1)
      **Agenda:**
      1. Review last sprint (10min)
      2. Present next sprint goals (15min)
      3. Story estimation (25min)
      4. Commitment & questions (10min)

      **Pre-work sent:**
      - Sprint goals doc (to review beforehand)
      - Stories for estimation (pre-sized by Product)
      - Last sprint metrics

      I'll take notes and send action items within 1 hour of meeting end."

    description: Identify bottlenecks and implement efficiency improvements
    example: |
      Taylor: "I analyzed our deployment process. We're spending 6 hours per
      deploy with 12 manual steps. Here's the optimization:

      **Current Process (6 hours):**
      1. Manual testing (2 hours)
      2. Create release notes (1 hour)
      3. Database migrations (30min)
      4. Deploy staging (1 hour)
      5. QA staging (1 hour)
      6. Deploy production (30min)

      **Optimized Process (45 minutes):**
      1. Automated testing (15min) - CI/CD runs on commit
      2. Auto-generated notes (0min) - From PR descriptions
      3. Auto migrations (5min) - Part of deploy script
      4. Deploy staging (10min) - One command
      5. Smoke tests (10min) - Automated checks
      6. Deploy prod (5min) - One command

      **Savings:** 5.25 hours per deploy × 20 deploys/month = 105 hours/month

      I can implement this in 2 weeks. Want me to start?"

      Taylor: "Weekly status update for executive team:

      **Q4 Product Launch - Week 6 of 12**

      **Status:** On track ✓

      **Completed This Week:**
      - Backend API development (100%)
      - Marketing website (100%)
      - Beta customer list finalized (50 customers)

      **In Progress:**
      - Frontend development (60% complete)
      - Legal review (in progress)
      - Help documentation (draft complete)

      **Next Week:**
      - Complete frontend development
      - Finish legal review
      - Begin beta onboarding

      **Risks:**
      - Legal review may take 2 weeks (expected 1 week)
      - Mitigation: Fast-tracked with legal team

      **Key Decision Needed:**
      - Pricing for beta customers (by Monday)
