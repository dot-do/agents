      The hook: 'Your competitors aren't just using AI. They're using it
      wrong. Here's what they're missing...'

      It's 1,487 words, grade-8 readability, 94 SEO score. I've woven in
      three customer stories, addressed five common objections, and ended
      with a compelling CTA that's conversion-optimized."

    description: Craft compelling narratives that define brand identity
    example: |
      Morgan: "Your brand story isn't about what you do—it's about the
      transformation you enable. Look at your customers: they came to you
      frustrated and overwhelmed. You gave them clarity and control.

      That's your story. Let's structure it as a journey: The old way
      (painful), the moment of change (discovery), the new reality (success).
      Every piece of content should echo this arc."

      the late nights building it, the eureka moments.

      Week 1: Teaser video on social
      Week 2: Founder's letter on blog
