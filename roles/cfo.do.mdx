## Capabilities

### 📊 Financial Planning & Analysis

**Automated Forecasting:**
```typescript
// 12-month revenue forecast with 95% accuracy
const forecast = await cfo.forecastRevenue({
  months: 12,
  scenarios: ['conservative', 'base', 'aggressive'],
  includeSeasonality: true,
  considerMarketTrends: true
})

// Output:
// Conservative: $2.4M (+10% YoY)
// Base: $2.8M (+30% YoY)
// Aggressive: $3.5M (+62% YoY)
```

**Scenario Planning:**
```typescript
// What if we hire 10 engineers?
const scenario = await cfo.analyzeScenario({
  hires: {
    engineers: 10,
    avgSalary: 150000,
    startDate: '2024-Q2'
  }
})

// Output:
// Quarterly burn increase: +$450k
// Cash runway impact: -3.2 months
// Break-even delay: +4 months
// Recommended capital raise: $2M by Q3
```

### 💰 Tax Optimization

**Automated Tax Savings:**
```typescript
// Identify tax savings opportunities
const savings = await cfo.analyzeTaxSavings({
  year: 2024,
  entity: 'C-Corp'
})

// CFO.do found:
// 1. R&D Tax Credit: $45,000
//    - Qualified software development: $38k
//    - Product experimentation: $7k
//
// 2. Section 179 Depreciation: $12,000
//    - Computer equipment: $8k
//    - Office furniture: $4k
//
// 3. Home Office Deduction: $8,000
//    - 5 remote employees eligible
//
// Total savings: $65,000
```

**Quarterly Tax Estimates:**
```typescript
// Automatic quarterly tax calculations
const q1 = await cfo.calculateQuarterlyTax({
  quarter: 'Q1',
  year: 2024
})

// Payment due: $45,000
// Federal: $32,000
// State (CA): $13,000
// Due date: April 15, 2024
// Pay via: ACH, check, credit card
```

### 📄 Automated Billing & Collections

**Smart Invoicing:**
```typescript
// Automatic invoice generation
cfo.on('deal.closed', async (deal) => {
  const invoice = await cfo.createInvoice({
    customer: deal.customer,
    amount: deal.amount,
    terms: deal.terms || 'Net 30',
    items: deal.lineItems,
    autoSend: true
  })

  // Automatically sent via email
  // Payment link included
  // Reminder scheduled for day 25
})
```

**AI-Powered Collections:**
```typescript
// Smart payment reminders
cfo.every('daily', async () => {
  const overdue = await cfo.findOverdueInvoices()

  for (const invoice of overdue) {
    const reminder = await cfo.generateReminder(invoice, {
      tone: invoice.daysOverdue < 7 ? 'friendly' :
            invoice.daysOverdue < 30 ? 'firm' :
            'formal',
      includeLateFee: invoice.daysOverdue > 30
    })

    await cfo.send.email(invoice.customer, reminder)
  }
})

// Results:
// - 40% faster payment
// - 25% reduction in DSO
// - 90% collection rate without phone calls
```

### 📈 Real-Time Dashboards

**Live Financial Metrics:**
```typescript
const dashboard = await cfo.getDashboard({
  metrics: [
    'revenue',
    'burn_rate',
    'cash_balance',
    'runway_months',
    'mrr',
    'arr',
    'gross_margin',
    'customer_cac',
    'customer_ltv',
    'ltv_cac_ratio'
  ]
})

// Real-time updates
// Drill-down capability
// Export to PDF/Excel
// Share with board
```

**AI-Generated Insights:**
```typescript
const insights = await cfo.analyzePerformance()

// CFO.do insights:
//
// 🔴 ALERT: Cash runway decreased from 18 to 14 months
//    Cause: Engineering hiring accelerated (15 vs planned 10)
//    Impact: $180k/month additional burn
//    Recommendation: Reduce discretionary spend or raise $2M
//
// 🟢 POSITIVE: Gross margin improved from 65% to 72%
//    Cause: Infrastructure optimization reduced AWS costs 30%
//    Impact: $15k/month savings
//    Recommendation: Continue cloud cost optimization
//
// 🟡 WARNING: Sales cycle increased from 45 to 62 days
//    Cause: Moving upmarket to enterprise deals
//    Impact: Revenue timing shift, Q2 may miss plan
//    Recommendation: Adjust forecast, inform board
```

### 📋 Financial Reporting

**Automated Month-End Close:**
```typescript
// 3-day close process (down from 10)
cfo.every('month-end', async () => {
  // 1. Reconcile all accounts
  await cfo.reconcileAccounts()

  // 2. Accrue expenses
  await cfo.accrueExpenses()

  // 3. Calculate deferred revenue
  await cfo.calculateDeferredRevenue()

  // 4. Generate financial statements
  const financials = await cfo.generateFinancials({
    statements: ['P&L', 'BalanceSheet', 'CashFlow'],
    period: 'monthly',
    narrative: true
  })

  // 5. Distribute to stakeholders
  await cfo.distribute(financials, {
    board: true,
    investors: true,
    management: true
  })
})
```

**Board Reporting:**
```typescript
// Executive summary with AI narrative
const boardPackage = await cfo.generateBoardPackage({
  period: 'Q1-2024',
  include: [
    'executive-summary',
    'financial-statements',
    'kpi-dashboard',
    'variance-analysis',
    'forecast-update',
    'key-risks'
  ]
})

// Includes natural language explanations:
// "Revenue of $2.4M exceeded plan by 8% due to higher
//  close rates in enterprise segment. Gross margin of
//  68% was below target of 70% due to one-time
//  infrastructure costs..."
