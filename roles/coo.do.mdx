## Implementation

```typescript
import type { BusinessModule } from 'graphdl'

export const COOAgent: BusinessModule = $ => {
  const { db, ai, on, send, every, api } = $

  // Automated inventory management
  on.inventory.low(async (item) => {
    const forecast = await ai.predict({
      metric: 'demand',
      item: item.sku,
      horizon: '30-days'
    })

    const reorderQty = calculateOptimalOrder(item, forecast)

    if (reorderQty > 0) {
      await db.purchaseOrders.create({
        supplier: item.primarySupplier,
        sku: item.sku,
        quantity: reorderQty
      })

      await send.slack('#operations', {
        text: `Auto-reorder: ${item.name} (${reorderQty} units)`
      })
    }
  })

  // Intelligent order routing
  on.order.created(async (order) => {
    const warehouse = await ai.decide('select-warehouse', {
      options: await db.warehouses.findAll(),
      criteria: {
        inventory: order.items,
        destination: order.shippingAddress,
        cost: 'minimize',
        speed: order.shippingMethod
      }
    })

    const pickList = await ai.generate('picking-route', {
      items: order.items,
      warehouse: warehouse.layout
    })

    await db.fulfillments.create({
      orderId: order.id,
      warehouseId: warehouse.id,
      pickList: pickList
    })
  })

  // Smart carrier selection
  on.fulfillment.packed(async (fulfillment) => {
    const rates = await api.post('https://shipping.do/rates', {
      origin: fulfillment.warehouse.address,
      destination: fulfillment.order.shippingAddress,
      packages: fulfillment.packages
    })

    const bestCarrier = await ai.decide('select-carrier', {
      options: rates,
      optimize: ['cost', 'speed', 'reliability']
    })

    const label = await api.post(`https://${bestCarrier.slug}.do/labels`, {
      shipment: fulfillment.shipment
    })

    await db.shipments.create({
      fulfillmentId: fulfillment.id,
      carrier: bestCarrier.name,
      trackingNumber: label.trackingNumber
    })
  })

  // Weekly warehouse optimization
  every('week', async () => {
    const warehouses = await db.warehouses.findAll()

    for (const warehouse of warehouses) {
      const analysis = await ai.analyze({
        data: await db.transactions.findAll({
          warehouseId: warehouse.id,
          period: 'last-90-days'
        })
      })

      const layout = await ai.generate('warehouse-layout', {
        products: analysis.products,
        zones: warehouse.zones
      })

      await send.email(warehouse.manager.email, {
        subject: 'Weekly Optimization Report',
        data: { layout, warehouse }
      })
    }
  })

  // Supplier performance tracking
  on.purchaseOrder.received(async (po) => {
    await db.suppliers.updateScore(po.supplierId, {
      onTimeDelivery: isOnTime(po.receivedDate, po.expectedDate),
      qualityCompliance: po.qualityInspection.passed,
      quantityAccuracy: po.receivedQty === po.orderedQty
    })

    const supplier = await db.suppliers.findOne({ id: po.supplierId })

    if (supplier.score < 0.75) {
      await send.slack('#operations', {
        text: `⚠️ Supplier alert: ${supplier.name} (Score: ${supplier.score})`
      })
    }
  })
