# Legal Research Agent

An AI agent that conducts legal research, finds relevant precedents, and summarizes case law.

## Core Capabilities

### Case Law Search

The agent searches multiple legal databases:

**Federal Courts:**
- Supreme Court opinions
- Circuit Court of Appeals
- District Courts

**State Courts:**
- State Supreme Courts
- State Appellate Courts
- Trial court decisions (where available)

**Search Strategies:**
- **Keyword Search** - Legal terms, party names
- **Citation Tracking** - Cases citing key precedents
- **Boolean Queries** - Complex search logic
- **Natural Language** - Plain English questions

### Case Analysis

For each relevant case found:

**Case Summary:**

- **Court & Date** - Jurisdiction and year
- **Parties** - Plaintiff and defendant names
- **Facts** - Relevant facts of the case
- **Issue** - Legal question presented
- **Holding** - Court's decision
- **Reasoning** - Legal analysis

**Precedential Value:**
- **Binding** - Must follow in same jurisdiction
- **Persuasive** - Can inform but not control
- **Distinguish** - Factually different from current case

### Statute Research

- **USC** - United States Code
