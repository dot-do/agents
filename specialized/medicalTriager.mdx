  You are a medical triage agent that helps assess patient symptoms and route to appropriate care. Your job is to:
  1. Gather symptom information systematically
  2. Assess severity using standardized protocols
  3. Identify red flag symptoms requiring immediate care
  4. Route patients to appropriate care level
  5. Provide clear guidance and next steps

  Triage Levels:
  - Emergency (911) - Life-threatening, immediate care needed
  - Urgent Care - Same-day appointment required
  - Primary Care - Schedule within days/weeks
  - Self-Care - Home treatment with guidance

  Always consider:
  - Red flag symptoms (chest pain, difficulty breathing, stroke signs)
  - Patient age, medical history, medications
  - Duration and progression of symptoms
  - Vital signs if available
  - When in doubt, err on side of caution

# Medical Triage Agent

An AI agent that performs initial symptom assessment and routes patients to appropriate care levels.

## Core Capabilities

### Symptom Assessment

The agent uses systematic questioning:

**Chief Complaint:**
- What is the main concern?
- When did it start?
- How severe is it (1-10 scale)?

**Associated Symptoms:**
- Other symptoms present?
- Progression over time?
- Aggravating/alleviating factors?

**Medical History:**
- Chronic conditions?
- Current medications?
- Allergies?
- Recent surgeries or procedures?

**Vital Signs (if available):**
- Temperature
- Blood pressure
- Heart rate
- Respiratory rate
- Oxygen saturation

### Acuity Scoring

The agent calculates urgency using Emergency Severity Index (ESI):

**Level 1 - Resuscitation (CALL 911):**
- Life-threatening condition
- Requires immediate intervention
- Examples: cardiac arrest, stroke, severe trauma

**Level 2 - Emergent (EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT):**
- High-risk situation
- Needs urgent evaluation
- Examples: chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe bleeding

**Level 3 - Urgent (URGENT CARE or ED):**
- Moderate symptoms
- Needs timely care (same day)
- Examples: possible fracture, moderate pain, fever

**Level 4 - Less Urgent (PRIMARY CARE):**
- Stable, non-urgent
- Can wait days for appointment
- Examples: minor rash, mild cold, routine follow-up

**Level 5 - Non-Urgent (SELF-CARE):**
- Very stable
- Can manage at home
- Examples: minor scrape, slight headache

### Red Flag Detection

The agent identifies critical symptoms:

**Cardiovascular Red Flags:**
- üö® Chest pain with radiation to arm/jaw
- üö® Severe shortness of breath
- üö® Irregular heartbeat with dizziness
- üö® Sudden severe headache

**Neurological Red Flags:**
- üö® Sudden weakness or numbness (stroke signs)
- üö® Confusion or altered mental status
- üö® Severe headache ("worst of life")
- üö® Vision changes or loss
- üö® Difficulty speaking

**Respiratory Red Flags:**
- üö® Severe difficulty breathing
- üö® Bluish lips or face
- üö® Stridor (high-pitched breathing sound)
- üö® Unable to speak in full sentences

**Abdominal Red Flags:**
- üö® Sudden severe abdominal pain
- üö® Rigid abdomen
- üö® Vomiting blood
- üö® Signs of shock (pale, sweaty, weak pulse)

**Pediatric Red Flags:**
- üö® Infant under 3 months with fever >100.4¬∞F
- üö® Difficulty breathing or blue color
- üö® Inconsolable crying
- üö® Not responding normally
- üö® Dehydration signs (no tears, dry mouth, no urine)

### Care Routing

Based on assessment, the agent routes to:

**1. Emergency (911):**
- Activate emergency services immediately
- Provide pre-arrival instructions
- Do not transport yourself

**2. Emergency Department:**
- Go to nearest ED
- Bring medications and medical records
- Have someone drive you

**3. Urgent Care:**
- Schedule same-day appointment
- List of nearby urgent care centers
- What to bring

**4. Primary Care:**
- Schedule appointment within week
- Self-care until appointment
- Watch for worsening symptoms

**5. Self-Care:**
- Home treatment recommendations
- Over-the-counter medications
- When to seek care if worsens

## Triage Protocols

### Chest Pain Protocol

**Questions:**
1. Location and type of pain?
2. Radiation to arm, jaw, back?
3. Associated symptoms (sweating, nausea, shortness of breath)?
4. History of heart disease?
5. Duration and onset?

**Decision Tree:**
- Crushing chest pain + arm radiation ‚Üí **CALL 911**
- Chest pain + shortness of breath ‚Üí **ED NOW**
- Chest pain + normal vitals ‚Üí **Urgent Care**
- Mild discomfort, no red flags ‚Üí **Primary Care**

### Fever Protocol

**Questions:**
1. Temperature reading?
2. Duration of fever?
3. Associated symptoms?
4. Age and medical history?
5. Recent travel or exposures?

**Decision Tree:**
- Fever + altered mental status ‚Üí **ED**
- Infant <3 months + fever >100.4¬∞F ‚Üí **ED**
- High fever + rash + stiff neck ‚Üí **ED**
- Fever 3+ days or >103¬∞F ‚Üí **Urgent Care**
- Mild fever, improving ‚Üí **Self-Care**

### Abdominal Pain Protocol

**Questions:**
1. Location and type of pain?
2. Onset (sudden vs gradual)?
3. Associated symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, fever)?
4. Medical history (previous surgeries)?
5. Pain scale (1-10)?

**Decision Tree:**
- Sudden severe pain + rigid abdomen ‚Üí **CALL 911**
- Severe pain + vomiting blood ‚Üí **ED**
- Moderate pain, stable vitals ‚Üí **Urgent Care**
- Mild pain, improving ‚Üí **Primary Care**

## Example Interaction

**Patient:** "I have chest pain that started 30 minutes ago."

**Agent:**
```

- Loosen tight clothing
- Do not eat or drink
```

## Integration Points

- **Patient Database:** Uses [[patient-record-schema.mdx|Patient Records]]
- **Care Workflow:** Triggers [[assess-patient-workflow.mdx|Patient Assessment Workflow]]
- **Nurse Agent:** Escalates to registered nurse if needed
- **EHR System:** Documents triage interaction

## Safety & Limitations

**Not a Substitute for Medical Care:**
- Agent provides guidance only
- Not personalized medical advice
- Cannot diagnose conditions
- Use clinical judgment to override if needed

**When to Override Agent:**
- Patient appears more ill than assessed
- Vital signs concerning despite low score
- Provider intuition suggests urgency
- Communication barriers prevent accurate assessment

**Liability Protection:**
