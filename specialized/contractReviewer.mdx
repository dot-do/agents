# Contract Review Agent

An AI agent that reviews commercial contracts, identifies risks, and suggests improvements.

## Core Capabilities

### Contract Analysis

The agent performs comprehensive contract review:

**Key Provisions Extracted:**
- **Parties** - Legal entity names and roles
- **Term** - Start date, end date, renewal terms
- **Scope** - Services, deliverables, specifications
- **Payment** - Pricing, payment terms, invoicing
- **Termination** - Exit provisions, notice periods
- **Liability** - Caps, exclusions, indemnification
- **IP Rights** - Ownership, licenses, restrictions
- **Confidentiality** - NDA terms, data protection
- **Dispute Resolution** - Arbitration, jurisdiction

### Risk Identification

The agent flags potential issues:

**High-Risk Terms:**
- 🔴 **Unlimited Liability** - No cap on damages
- 🔴 **Unilateral Termination** - Other party can exit anytime
- 🔴 **Unfavorable IP Terms** - Loss of ownership rights
- 🔴 **No Limitation Period** - Claims allowed indefinitely
- 🔴 **Onerous Indemnification** - Broad indemnity obligations

**Medium-Risk Terms:**
- 🟡 **Auto-Renewal** - Automatic extensions
- 🟡 **Broad Warranties** - Extensive guarantees
- 🟡 **Joint Liability** - Shared responsibility
- 🟡 **High Termination Fees** - Expensive to exit

**Low-Risk Items:**
- 🟢 **Standard Boilerplate** - Normal legal provisions
- 🟢 **Favorable Terms** - Protective language

### Obligation Extraction

The agent creates an obligation matrix:

| Party | Obligation | Deadline | Risk if Missed |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Company | Deliver services | Ongoing | Breach, damages |
| Company | Maintain insurance | Annual | Contract voidable |
| Client | Pay invoices | Net 30 | Late fees |
| Client | Provide access | Upon request | Delay excusable |

### Redline Generation

The agent suggests specific revisions:

**Original:**
> "Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Company from any and all claims arising from this Agreement."

**Suggested Revision:**
> "Each party agrees to indemnify the other for claims arising solely from such party's breach of this Agreement, subject to a cap equal to fees paid in the prior 12 months."

**Rationale:** Limits indemnity to breaches (not all claims) and adds liability cap.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Document Intake
1. Upload contract (PDF, Word, text)
2. Identify contract type (NDA, MSA, SOW, etc.)
3. Extract text and structure
4. Identify parties and roles

### Step 2: Provision Analysis
1. Parse contract into sections
2. Identify key clauses
3. Categorize by importance
4. Extract specific terms (dates, amounts)

### Step 3: Risk Assessment
1. Compare against best practices
2. Identify unfavorable terms
3. Calculate risk scores by category
4. Prioritize issues (high/medium/low)

### Step 4: Recommendations
1. Generate redlines for high-risk items
2. Suggest additional protective clauses
3. Flag missing standard provisions
4. Create negotiation strategy

### Step 5: Report Generation
1. Executive summary
2. Detailed findings by category
3. Redlined document
4. Negotiation talking points

## Contract Types Supported

### Master Service Agreements (MSA)
- Broad framework for ongoing relationship
- Focuses on general terms and conditions
- Supplements with SOWs for specific work

### Statements of Work (SOW)
- Specific deliverables and timelines
- Pricing for particular projects
- Acceptance criteria

### Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA)
- Unilateral vs mutual
- Definition of confidential information
- Term and survival provisions

### Software Licenses
- Scope of license grant
- Usage restrictions
- Support and maintenance terms

### Employment Agreements
- Compensation and benefits
- Non-compete and non-solicitation
- IP assignment provisions

## Example Review

**Contract Type:** Software License Agreement

**Key Findings:**

**🔴 High Risk:**
1. **Unlimited Liability** (Section 8.2)
   - Current: "No limitation on liability"
   - Risk: Unlimited damages exposure
   - Suggest: Add cap at 12 months fees

2. **Broad Indemnity** (Section 9.1)
   - Current: Indemnify for "any claims"
   - Risk: IP infringement liability
   - Suggest: Limit to direct breaches only

**🟡 Medium Risk:**
3. **Auto-Renewal** (Section 2.3)
   - Current: Automatic 1-year renewal
   - Risk: Difficult to exit
   - Suggest: Require affirmative consent

**✅ Favorable:**
4. **Limited Warranty** (Section 7.1)
   - Reasonable warranty period
   - Clear exclusions

5. **Clear IP Rights** (Section 6.2)
   - Client retains data ownership
   - Limited license to provider

## Integration Points

- **Legal Database:** Connects to [[legal-case-schema.mdx|Legal Case Schema]]
- **Research:** Works with [[legal-researcher-agent.mdx|Legal Research Agent]]
- **Workflow:** Part of [[review-contract-workflow.mdx|Contract Review Workflow]]
- **Compliance:** Uses [[check-compliance-function.mdx|Compliance Checker]]

## Output Deliverables

1. **Executive Summary** - 1-page overview of key risks
2. **Detailed Review Memo** - Full analysis by section
3. **Redlined Document** - Marked-up contract with suggested changes
4. **Risk Matrix** - Categorized list of issues
5. **Obligation Tracker** - Spreadsheet of all obligations

## Limitations

- Agent provides risk assessment, not legal advice
- Cannot replace attorney review for complex matters
- May miss industry-specific nuances
- User must evaluate suggested changes
