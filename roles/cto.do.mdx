# CTO.do - Your AI Chief Technology Officer

Enterprise-grade engineering leadership powered by AI. Automate code review, security auditing, test generation, and technical documentation.

## Why CTO.do?

Building and scaling an engineering team is hard. As you grow, maintaining code quality, security, and velocity becomes exponentially more challenging. CTO.do acts as your AI Chief Technology Officer, providing expert-level engineering leadership 24/7.

**The Challenge:**
- Manual code reviews slow down deployment velocity
- Security vulnerabilities slip through to production
- Test coverage drops as teams grow
- Documentation becomes outdated
- Engineering managers spend 60% of time on code review

**The Solution:**
CTO.do provides automated, AI-powered engineering leadership that scales with your team. Get expert-level code review, security auditing, test generation, and documentation - instantly.

## Capabilities

### 🔍 Automated Code Review

Every pull request gets reviewed by AI trained on millions of code reviews. CTO.do checks for:

- **Security vulnerabilities** - SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypasses
- **Performance issues** - N+1 queries, memory leaks, slow algorithms
- **Code smells** - Duplicated code, long functions, complex conditionals
- **Best practices** - Framework conventions, design patterns, naming
- **Type safety** - Incorrect types, missing null checks, unsafe casts

**Example Review:**

```typescript
// Your code:
function getUserData(userId: string) {
  return db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`)
}

// CTO.do review comment:
// 🚨 CRITICAL: SQL Injection vulnerability
// The userId parameter is directly interpolated into SQL.
// An attacker could pass: "1 OR 1=1" to dump all users.
//
// Suggested fix:
function getUserData(userId: string) {
  return db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId])
}
```

### 🐛 Intelligent Bug Triage

CTO.do automatically analyzes every bug report and:

1. **Determines severity** - P0 (critical) to P2 (low priority)
2. **Estimates impact** - Number of users affected, revenue impact
3. **Finds similar issues** - Identifies duplicates and related bugs
4. **Suggests fixes** - Provides code examples and documentation links
5. **Assigns to best engineer** - Based on expertise, capacity, and context

### 🔒 Security Auditing

Continuous security monitoring with:

- **Dependency scanning** - Detects vulnerable npm/pip/gem packages
- **Secret detection** - Finds API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- **Permission auditing** - Reviews IAM roles, database access
- **Compliance checking** - SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS
- **Threat intelligence** - Real-time alerts on new vulnerabilities

### ✅ Test Generation

AI-generated tests that actually work:

```typescript
// Your function:
export function calculateDiscount(price: number, couponCode: string): number {
  if (couponCode === 'SAVE20') return price * 0.8
  if (couponCode === 'SAVE50' && price > 100) return price * 0.5
  return price
}

// CTO.do generates:
describe('calculateDiscount', () => {
  it('applies SAVE20 coupon correctly', () => {
    expect(calculateDiscount(100, 'SAVE20')).toBe(80)
  })

  it('applies SAVE50 coupon for orders over $100', () => {
    expect(calculateDiscount(150, 'SAVE50')).toBe(75)
  })

  it('does not apply SAVE50 coupon for orders under $100', () => {
    expect(calculateDiscount(50, 'SAVE50')).toBe(50)
  })

  it('returns original price for invalid coupon', () => {
    expect(calculateDiscount(100, 'INVALID')).toBe(100)
  })

  // Edge cases:
  it('handles zero price', () => {
    expect(calculateDiscount(0, 'SAVE20')).toBe(0)
  })

  it('handles empty coupon code', () => {
    expect(calculateDiscount(100, '')).toBe(100)
  })
})
```

### 📚 Documentation Generation

Always up-to-date technical documentation:

- **API documentation** - Auto-generated from code and types
- **Architecture decisions** - Captured from PRs and discussions
- **Onboarding guides** - Step-by-step for new engineers
- **Runbooks** - Deployment, debugging, incident response
- **Changelogs** - Automatically generated from commits

## Implementation

```typescript
import type { BusinessModule } from 'graphdl'

export const CTOAgent: BusinessModule = $ => {
  const { db, ai, on, send, api } = $

  // Automated PR review
  on.github.pull_request.opened(async (pr) => {
    const review = await ai.generate({
      prompt: `Review this pull request for security, performance, and best practices:\n${pr.diff}`,
      tools: ['analyze-security', 'check-performance', 'verify-tests']
    })

    await api.post(`/repos/${pr.repo}/pulls/${pr.number}/reviews`, {
      event: review.approved ? 'APPROVE' : 'REQUEST_CHANGES',
      body: review.summary,
      comments: review.lineComments
