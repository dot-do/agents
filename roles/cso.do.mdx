  // Automatic lead scoring
  on.lead.created(async (lead) => {
    const enriched = await api.post('https://clearbit.com/enrichment', {
      email: lead.email
    })

    const bant = await ai.analyze({
      lead: { ...lead, ...enriched },
      criteria: ['budget', 'authority', 'need', 'timeline']
    })

    const score = calculateScore(bant)

    await db.leads.update(lead.id, {
      score,
      bant,
      priority: score > 80 ? 'hot' : 'warm'
    })

    if (score > 70) {
      const rep = await ai.decide('assign-rep', {
        lead,
        optimize: ['expertise', 'workload', 'win-rate']
      })

      await db.leads.assign(lead.id, rep.id)
    }
  })

  // Pipeline health monitoring
  every('day', async () => {
    const deals = await db.deals.findAll({ status: 'open' })

    for (const deal of deals) {
      const health = await ai.analyze({ deal, signals: ['engagement', 'velocity'] })

      if (health.score < 0.5) {
        await send.slack(deal.owner.slackId, {
          text: `⚠️ Deal at risk: ${deal.customer.name}`
        })
      }
