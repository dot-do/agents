**CISO.do** is your AI-powered security leader, protecting your organization through continuous vulnerability management, real-time threat detection, compliance automation, and security training. Achieve SOC 2 certification, 99.9% threat detection, and <4 hour mean time to response.

## Why CISO.do?

Security teams are overwhelmed:
- **Manual scanning** can't keep up with modern development velocity
- **Alert fatigue** from high false positive rates in traditional SIEM
- **Compliance requirements** demand continuous evidence collection
- **Access management** becomes unwieldy as teams scale
- **Human error** remains the #1 security vulnerability

CISO.do solves these challenges with AI that continuously monitors, detects, responds, and trains 24/7.

## Key Capabilities

### üîí Continuous Vulnerability Management
Automated scanning across your entire stack with AI-powered risk prioritization. Remediate critical vulnerabilities 73% faster with zero blind spots.

### üõ°Ô∏è Real-Time Threat Detection & Response
AI-powered SIEM with behavioral analytics and anomaly detection. Catch 99.9% of threats with <0.1% false positives and automated incident response.

### ‚úÖ Compliance Automation & Monitoring
Continuous compliance monitoring for SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS with automated evidence collection. Always audit-ready.

### üîë Identity & Access Management
Zero-trust access control with automated provisioning, role-based permissions, and continuous verification. Zero unauthorized access incidents.

### üéì Security Awareness Training
Automated phishing simulations and security training campaigns. Reduce security incidents 67% through continuous education.

## Real-World Results

- **FinTech Platform**: SOC 2 certified in 8 weeks (75% faster), $180K annual savings
- **HealthTech SaaS**: 99.9% threat detection, 100% HIPAA compliance, 4.2x team productivity
